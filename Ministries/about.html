        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><b>The Living Faith Church Worldwide (also known as Winners' Chapel)</b> is an Evangelical charismatic Christian denomination and a megachurch. The Headquarters is located in Canaan-land Ota, Lagos, Nigeria. The organization has since become a global network of churches with over 6 million+ members in 147 countries.  
          <br>
          <br>
        <b>Winners Chapel International</b> was started on the 5th December 1991 to proclaim the Word of Faith, in the power of the Holy Ghost, for the libration of all those oppressed in any area of life by the works of the kingdom of darkness so that they can experience the reality of the abundant life that Lord Jesus Christ came to give. The Ministry is committed to the specific mandates of preaching the Word of Faith, walking in prosperity, and operating in the supernatural through the manifestation of signs and wonders.
        </p>

        <div class="about-1">
          <h2>THE LIBERATION MINISTRY</h2> 
            <p>Our Mandate for ministry was received from the LORD Himself, in an 18 hour vision.  During this vision, a commission was received from the LORD  to liberate mankind in all facets of human existence, 
            to restore broken destinies, to bring healing to the infirmed.<br>

            This was the Divine mandate received from the LORD :
            <br>
            <i><b>  “The hour has come to liberate the world from all oppressions of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith, and I am sending you to undertake this task.”</b></i>
            <br>
            Today, testimonies of liberation through our messages, books, tapes, magazines and other periodicals are most humbling. The word of faith is working like fire for the liberation of mankind across the nations.
            <br>
