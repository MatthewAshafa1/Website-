            <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p>
                The Teens Church at Winners Chapel Ondo road is designed to reach out to our teenagers with the liberating message of faith to build them up for a glorious future. It is common knowledge that there is wide spread decadence within the teenagers of our land. However, contrary to that moral erosion, God is set to raise men and women of honor and glory from among them. It is with this at heart that our teen’s church tirelessly pursues the liberation mandate as it concerns the teenagers in the language that they understand and relate to, losing them from the decadence and setting them up for a destiny of glory. <br>
                Therefore, all teenagers are welcome to partake of this colorful ministry to deliver a glorious destiny. You may find the details below helpful in giving directions concerning some of the events in our teens church calendar. In addition to these set programs, there will be special programs brought to your notice from time to time for the edification of our teenagers. We encourage you to take part in them and they will bring a change of story. <br>

            <h2>OUR CHURCH</h2>
            <p>Living Faith Church Worldwide (also known as Winners' Chapel) is an Evangelical charismatic Christian denomination and a megachurch. The headquarters is located in Ota, Nigeria. The organization has since become a global network of churches with over 6 million members in 147 countries.<br>
              Winners Chapel International was started on the 5th December 1991   to proclaim the Word of Faith, in the power of the Holy Ghost, for the liberation of all those oppressed in any area of life by the works
             of the kingdom of darkness so that they can experience the reality of the abundant life that Lord Jesus Christ came to give.
            
            The ministry is committed to the specific mandates of preaching the Word of Faith, walking in prosperity, and operating in the supernatural through the manifestation of signs and wonders.</p>

           <h2>THE LIBERATION MINISTRY</h2> 
            <p>Our Mandate for ministry was received from the LORD Himself, in an 18 hour vision.  During this vision, a commission was received from the LORD  to liberate mankind in all facets of human existence, 
            to restore broken destinies, to bring healing to the infirmed.<br>

            This was the Divine mandate received from the LORD:
            <br>
            <i><b>  “The hour has come to liberate the world from all oppressions of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith, and I am sending you to undertake this task.”</b></i>
            <br>
            Today, testimonies of liberation through our messages, books, tapes, magazines and other periodicals are most humbling. The word of faith is working like fire for the liberation of mankind across the nations.
